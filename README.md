## ⚠️ URGENT: Cluely Is Not What You Think It Is

We built this after actually reading Cluely's terms of service. Here's what they LITERALLY say:

**"Cluely captures visual data from your screen"** - That's right, they're SCREENSHOTTING everything you do.

**"audio inputs for the purpose of providing real-time assistance"** - They're also RECORDING what you say.

**"You grant Cluely a worldwide, royalty-free license to use, process, store, and analyze your Contributions"** - They own rights to YOUR homework, YOUR resume, YOUR everything.

**"Monitor your use... take appropriate legal action"** - They're watching you AND can sue you.

**They're storing EVERYTHING you've ever asked for help with:**
- 🎓 Every homework assignment and essay
- 📝 Every resume you've "enhanced"
- 💕 Dating profiles you got help with
- 💰 Tax questions you thought were private
- 🏥 Medical forms you needed assistance on
- 📄 Legal documents you weren't sure about
- 🏛️ Grant proposals that needed "polishing"
- ✈️ Immigration papers you got help with

**One database. Every lie you've ever told. Forever. WITH SCREENSHOTS.**

💭 **They literally take "visual data from your screen" - your banking tabs, your emails, EVERYTHING visible while you use their app.**

## 🚨 What "Visual Data" and "Audio Inputs" REALLY Mean

When Cluely is running, they can see AND hear:
- 👀 Your other browser tabs (banking? medical records?)
- 📧 Email notifications that pop up
- 💬 Messages from your spouse/boss/side piece
- 🔐 Any passwords you type (if visible)
- 📱 Everything on your screen, not just their app
- 🎤 Everything you say (even background conversations)
- 🔊 Any audio playing on your device

And they keep a "worldwide, royalty-free license" to it all. Forever.

## 💣 The Universal Blackmail Machine

Think about it. Cluely's pitch is "cheat on ANYTHING." That means they're collecting:

### 💼 Professional Fraud Database
```json
{
  "user_id": "anon_12345",
  "resume_lies": [
    {
      "claim": "Led team of 50",
      "reality": "Intern who got coffee",
      "company": "Goldman Sachs",
      "flagged_for": "background_check"
    }
  ],
  "linkedin_enhancements": ["fake_certification", "inflated_title"],
  "future_employer_alert": true
}
```

### 💕 Relationship Destruction Archive
- That dating profile that said you're 6'2"
- Messages to multiple matches you needed help with
- "How to explain this to my wife" queries
- Anniversary excuses you generated

### 🎓 Academic Integrity Violations
- Every essay you didn't write yourself
- Test answers you needed help with
- Recommendation letters you "drafted"
- Scholarship applications with "help"

### 💸 Financial Crime Evidence
- "How to word this tax deduction"
- "Is this technically fraud?"
- "Grant proposal creative language"
- Bankruptcy filing assistance

### 🏥 Medical & Legal Nightmares
- Disability claims you needed help with
- Insurance forms with "creative interpretations"
- Legal documents that needed "clarification"
- Immigration applications with "enhanced" details

## 😱 The Business Model Nobody Talks About

If user data is the product, who might be buying? Think about it:

**Potential "Employer Package"** 
- Could they sell resume verification data?
- What if they cross-reference your old queries?
- Is "integrity scoring" the future of hiring?

**Possible "Legal Discovery Suite"**
- Divorce lawyers love digital evidence
- Every message you got help with is stored
- Timestamps tell stories

**Hypothetical "Compliance Tools"**
- What if tax authorities could check your queries?
- Insurance companies verifying claims?
- Academic institutions checking authenticity?

*Just asking questions. Check their privacy policy.*

## 🎯 Who Could Buy This Data? LITERALLY ANYONE

Think about who might pay for your "visual screen data" and query history:

1. **Your Employer** - Current or future
2. **Your Ex** - In divorce proceedings  
3. **Insurance Companies** - Denying your claims
4. **Law Enforcement** - Building cases
5. **Stalkers** - Yeah, think about that
6. **Competitors** - Business or personal
7. **Journalists** - If you ever become newsworthy
8. **Blackmailers** - The screenshots alone...
9. **Anyone with $$$** - It's just data for sale

## 🛡️ How Clueless is Different

### We Store NOTHING. Zero. Nada.
```javascript
// Our entire data collection system:
function collectUserData(data) {
  // No seriously, that's it
  // We literally cannot blackmail you
  // Because we have nothing
}
```

### Everything Dies on Your Device
- Close the app = conversation gone
- No accounts = no identity
- No cloud = no evidence
- Your secrets die with your laptop

### Open Source (Because Transparency > Profit)
- Verify our claims yourself
- See exactly what we DON'T store
- Fork it if you don't trust us
- Run your own instance

## 📊 Cluely vs Clueless: The Terrifying Truth

| What They Store | Cluely | Clueless |
|-----------------|--------|----------|
| Your Screen Content | ✅ Screenshots everything | ❌ Can't see your screen |
| All Your Queries | ✅ Forever with "worldwide license" | ❌ Never |
| Banking Tabs | ✅ "Visual data" includes all | ❌ No access |
| Private Messages | ✅ If visible on screen | ❌ Zero visibility |
| Medical Records | ✅ If you had them open | ❌ None |
| Passwords | ✅ If typed while visible | ❌ Nothing |
| Available to Buy | ✅ To anyone who pays | ❌ Nothing to sell |

## 🔥 What Could Happen (Based on Their Terms of Service)

> "Imagine getting rejected from a job because HR bought data about that resume you 'polished' in college." - What if?

> "Picture your divorce lawyer getting a history of every message you asked for help with." - It's technically possible

> "What if the IRS could buy your tax-related queries?" - Check their privacy policy

> "Imagine colleges checking if your application essays were 'assisted'." - They don't say they won't

> "What happens when insurance companies want to verify your claims?" - Good question to ask Cluely

> "Your kid uses it for homework. What if that follows them forever?" - Their data retention policy is... vague

## 🚨 The Time Bomb in Your Future

Every time you use Cluely for ANYTHING:

1. **Job Applications** → Future termination
2. **Dating** → Divorce evidence  
3. **Taxes** → Audit triggers
4. **Legal** → Prosecution evidence
5. **Medical** → Claim denials
6. **Immigration** → Application rejection

It's not paranoia if they're actually storing it.
